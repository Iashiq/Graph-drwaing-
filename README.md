# Graph-drawing
A C++ program to draw graph. I used OpenGL for this purpose. OpenGL(Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
The main functionality of the program is every time to run the program it changes the structure of the graph, means it rendomly distributes the edges and nodes of the graph and changes their location.
